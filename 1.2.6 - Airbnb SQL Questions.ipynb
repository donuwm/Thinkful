    "Answer:  Months of March, April and May are the cheapest months by average, so Spring is the cheapest time to go to San Francisco.  The busiest time of year is presumably at the time where prices are most expensive, so Feb, July and August seem to be the busiest.  It looks like there might be so erroneous data, given there are max values of 220,713.00 for the month of February and March; January also has a max value of 162,032.00.  These high values could be due to the fact that they span many days or weeks or months, so more investigation is needed.  \n",

    "A better way to evaluate the prices per listing id would be to analyze the history of prices obtained per listing id, so we can see that prices where the renatals actually occurred. This information was not available as part of this exercise."
