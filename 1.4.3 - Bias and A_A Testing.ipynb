One week might confuse people and they may want to let the idea sink in a little before participating.  Many or most of the customers probably wouldn't even know about the program after just one week.  Probably looking 3 or 6 months out would be a better study, but then there are probably many other variables within the company that have changed that it could be difficult to attribute an increase in visits to the introduction of the loyalty program.\n"
